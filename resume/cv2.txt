I am a full-stack web software engineer. I'm a professional who is easy to talk to and easy to work with. Sometimes I make jokes and people say they are funny.

Not only that, but my code is clean, robust, readable, maintainable, and highly tested. Testing is the key point in developing an app that's is going to be larger than a basic ToDo list app.

I'll be happy to provide you with the best solutions tailored specifically to your business needs. It doesn't matter if you're technical or not, I can communicate the features that your business needs on all levels. I constantly improve my technical skills by following the latest news, watching screencasts, attending conferences.

Availability is the key. I'm available to work on any day of the week and if sometimes I'm not, I will be giving you a lot of notifications of that. I have worked with plenty of clients around the globe launching successful projects and have had no problems scheduling a good time that would work for both of us.
